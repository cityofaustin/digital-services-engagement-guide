In Part 1, we covered a number of topics regarding the department or working group you’re project is directly partnering with to improve a city service. As we’ve already noted, that organization does not exist as an island, but rather is incredibly interwoven and interdependent within a larger system of city groups.  Meaningful engagement, and truly your project’s success, means expanding your view beyond your partner to all key players involved. Why? Because success means thinking long-term: what will you innovate through this project, and how will it impact the rest of the system? To create enduring transformation, you need the buy-in, support, and collaboration of key staff across the system.
